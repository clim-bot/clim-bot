# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about learning and building with modern web and game development technologies.

## What I'm Learning

### Web Development Stack
- **Ruby on Rails** - Building robust web applications with this powerful framework
- **Hotwire Turbo** - Creating reactive, SPA-like experiences without writing JavaScript
- **Hotwire Native for iOS** - Bridging the gap between web and native mobile apps

### Game Development
- **Unity** - Exploring game development and interactive experiences

## Current Focus

I'm currently diving deep into:
- Building full-stack applications with Rails and Hotwire
- Understanding the Turbo Frame and Turbo Stream concepts
- Creating iOS apps that leverage my web stack knowledge
- Learning C# for Unity game development
- Experimenting with 2D and 3D game mechanics

## Projects I'm Working On

- **Rails + Hotwire Apps** - Building reactive web applications without the complexity of traditional SPAs
- **Hotwire Native iOS Apps** - Converting web apps into native iOS experiences
- **Unity Games** - Creating fun, interactive games while learning game design principles
