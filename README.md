👋 **Hi, I’m Christopher Lim**

I’m a lifelong learner, builder, and family man with nearly a decade of experience across software quality assurance, product development, and startups. I’m passionate about making technology approachable, meaningful, and rooted in real human needs.

My journey began in healthcare, but I quickly found my calling in tech—starting in QA and automation, and gradually moving into software development. Today, I’m focused on building purposeful web apps using **Ruby on Rails 8**, **Hotwire**, and **StimulusJS**, while still applying the same discipline and clarity I learned from years of testing and leading QA teams.

💻 **What I Do Now**  
- Building **Devout**, a prayer and rosary tracker that blends faith and technology  
- Designing responsive UI/UX with **Tailwind CSS** and enhancing interactivity with **StimulusJS**  
- Leading QA strategy, automation, and team mentorship in software projects  
- Writing clean, scalable code and iterating with a balance of speed and care  

🔧 **Tech Stack**  
Ruby on Rails · Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) · Tailwind CSS · Cypress · Selenium · Postman · RSpec · Python · PostgreSQL · SQLite · Docker · AWS

🛠 **Beyond the Code**  
I believe in clear communication, continuous improvement, and staying grounded in family and faith. Whether I’m shipping features or teaching my kids how to code, I build with purpose and care.

📬 **Let’s Connect**  
This site is where I share thoughts on software, fitness, faith, and building things that matter. If you’re into web and app ideas, continuous learning, or value-centered tech—welcome home.
